<h2>📱 About the App</h2>

<p>
Mom's Kitchen allows users to browse food items, manage favorites and cart, place orders, and track their order history.
The app is designed to simulate a real restaurant workflow rather than a large aggregator like Swiggy or Zomato.

From authentication to order confirmation, every step is handled inside the app to provide a complete end-to-end ordering experience.

<h2>⚙️ Challenges & Learnings</h2>

<p>
While developing this app, managing data flow across multiple sections like menu, favorites, cart, and order history was challenging.
Handling these interactions through adapter-based architecture required careful debugging and restructuring.
</p>

<p>
Another challenge was ensuring the correct data was retrieved and displayed without crashes.
Through continuous testing and refinement, these issues were resolved, resulting in a stable and smooth experience.
